About me
======


As a PhD student at the University of Minnesota, my research focuses on exploring effective ways for universities and management agencies to establish meaningful partnerships with diverse communities for conservation management. Under the guidance of Dr. David Fulton and Dr. Tiffany Wolf, I am engaged in several community-focused projects that aim to understand the perspectives and knowledge of tribal, Hmong, and Amish communities regarding chronic wasting disease (CWD). With these communities, I am developing community-tailored outreach materials and facilitating the co-creation of CWD management plans. Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Biology at Carleton College and a Masters at the University of Minnesota where I conducted research on wolf diet in the Greater Voyageurs Ecosystem, using stable isotope analysis.
